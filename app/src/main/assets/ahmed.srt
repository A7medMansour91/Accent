1
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,248
<i>Elegio, how may I help you?</i>

2
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,880
<i>Yes, I'd like to make a reservation
for tonight, please.</i>

3
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,010
<i>- Sorry. We're booked months in advance.
MAN". Okay. I understand.</i>

4
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,810
Thank you very much.

5
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,728
<i>Elegio reservations, how may I help you?</i>

6
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,326
Order.

7
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,648
- Is that ready? Thanks.
- Yeah.

8
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,130
Gets another dollop of the burrata.
There you go.

9
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,642
No problem. I can get that for you, sir.

10
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,011
Okay, you know what?

11
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,523
So, yeah, you know...

12
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,167
...he could be here any minute now.

13
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,766
Ah, heh-heh.

14
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,725
Oh, look, you know what?

15
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,644
He's right there. That's my friend.

16
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,721
Will you be my boyfriend?

17
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,041
Just for a minute.

18
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,247
- You're not a serial killer, are you?
-That depends.

19
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,880
How many times does it take
to get to "serial"?

20
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,040
Five.

21
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,686
Oh, no, we're good.

22
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,040
Jess.

23
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,446
Nicky.

24
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,604
Heh. Burgundy.

25
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,404
Very good.

26
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,446
- It's very confusing, isn't it?
- Hm.

27
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,290
How do you know it all?

28
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,761
- Mostly from drinking.
-Mm.

29
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,571
Yeah. More you drink, more you learn.

30
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,770
In that case, I am, uh,
the foremost expert in Jï¿½gerbombs.

31
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,528
I will walk you through it all...

32
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,286
It's been a pleasure to serve you,
Chef Oshowole.

33
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,691
Chef who?

34
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,649
Uh, Oshowole.

35
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,842
Yeah. Heh.

36
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,209
You know, it may be the roofies talking,
but this was really fun.

37
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,364
Thank you. Thank you for rescuing me.

38
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,883
- Yeah. We showed him.
-Yeah.

39
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,281
Gotta respect him.
He left it all on the field.

40
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,889
- That's what I'm missing out on tonight?
-Ha-ha-ha.

41
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,280
Can I walk you somewhere?

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,926
Actually, I'm staying here.

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,484
Upstairs.

44
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,091
Oh, really.

45
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,003
- Oh, my God. It's my husband.
-Shut the fuck up.

46
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,969
- Jared, wait.
-Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

47
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,929
- I'll fucking kill you.
-Just let him go.

48
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,730
No fucking way. He's fucking dead.

49
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,451
Give me one fucking reason
why I shouldn't do it.

50
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,329
- I'm drawing a blank.
-What?

51
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,490
I think you should shoot me.
Let's be honest, you've been aggrieved.

52
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,529
Don't mess with him, Nicky,
he's done hard time.

53
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,444
I've done fucking hard time.

54
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,762
If you had any idea what I was
about to do to her...

55
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,288
- Shut up, man.
-She was gonna be no good to you after that.

56
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,920
- So you should really shoot me.
-What the fuck?

57
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,602
- What kind of stuff are we talking about?
-Saudi bachelor party shit.

58
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,489
Saudi bachelor party?

59
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,325
R. Kelly drop-cloth shit.

60
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,686
Please, come on, shoot me.

61
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,042
Stop fucking around.
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

62
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,680
You'd really be doing me a favor.
Cancer.

63
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,321
Tumor the size of a peach.

64
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,970
Pull the trigger, you'll see.

65
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,565
You--? You got cancer?

66
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,042
- He's onto us.
-Shit! I knew this wasn't gonna fucking work!

67
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,248
- You guys suck.
-Just give us the money.

68
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,965
- Or?
- He'll shoot you in the neck.

69
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,488
I don't wanna shoot a guy with cancer.
Grandma Mukulski had cancer.

70
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,405
- He doesn't have cancer, you idiot!
-You guys really boned this thing.

71
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,722
First of all, you gotta wait
till she gets my pants off.

72
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,963
And then you gotta give me a chance
to run. That's how you get the money.

73
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,208
And you never drop the con.

74
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,566
You never break.

75
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,006
Die with the lie.

76
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,446
When did you make us?

77
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,080
Uh, when you stole the wallet
from the bum downstairs.

78
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,571
Bullshit.

79
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,725
No, real shit.

80
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,082
Then Why'd you come up here
if you're so smart?

81
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,608
Professional curiosity.

82
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,290
And I like boobs, you know.

83
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,930
I figured it was a win-win.

84
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,641
- All thumbs, sweetheart. It was a bum lift.
-It was a great lift.

85
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,690
Please. He was so shithoused,
you could've taken his appendix.

86
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,569
You suck.

87
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,922
You really should be more aware.

88
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,924
I've been behind you for two blocks.
You didn't see me?

89
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,481
I don't have eyes in the back of my head.

90
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,928
Well, if you're gonna play this game,
you might wanna grow a pair.

91
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,120
I can take care of myself.

92
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,964
No, you're gonna get hurt.

93
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,690
Let me buy you coffee.

94
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,450
I don't drink coffee.

95
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,486
Fine.

96
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,486
Fine.

97
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,366
So, what's your thing?

98
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,729
- Inside? Roper? You can tell me.
-Mm.

99
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,769
Everything. Been in this game so long.

100
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,969
- I wanna cannon. That's what I wanna do.
-Oh, really?

101
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,168
- Yeah.
-Yeah, okay.
-Yeah, okay.

102
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,125
My grandfather used to run
a crooked game in Harlem.

103
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,971
Eventually, my father started
shilling for him.

104
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,366
Uh...

105
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,124
One day they get burned.

106
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,568
Mobbed-up guy catches them
throwing signals.

107
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,008
Everybody's guns come out. Standoff.

108
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,162
No way out. Except one.

109
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,607
The Toledo Panic Button.

110
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,606
What the hell is that?

111
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,121
You shoot your partner.
It proves you're not together.

112
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,488
You kill your partner?

113
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,651
You hope you don't.

114
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,205
Does it work?

115
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,170
He's 0 for 3.

116
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,006
So your father killed your grandfather?

117
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,446
That's the world you're in.

118
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,364
Dabblers get killed.

119
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,808
Look, I wasn't born into this like you.

120
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,645
I was a dyslexic foster kid.

121
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,131
No prospects, no future.

122
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,681
I mean, it's a minor miracle
I'm not a hooker right now.

123
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,080
- Tutor me.
-No.

124
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,810
- Why not?
-I'm headed out of town.

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,365
Well, wait, look, I can pay you.

126
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,606
- If that helps.
-Whose wallet is that?

127
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,361
Uh, "Dr. Peter Woshilak."

128
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,088
All right, we're gonna make this quick
because it's really cold.

129
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,722
Now I'm gonna show you a few touches,
but at the end of the day...

130
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,724
...this is a game of focus.

131
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,888
- That's very clever.
-All right, now, attention is like a spotlight.

132
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,205
And our job...

133
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,324
...is to dance in the darkness.

134
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,849
I didn't even feel you take that.

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,846
The human brain is slow,
and it cannot multitask.

136
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,323
Jesus. When--?

137
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,642
All right, I'm sure you can flip a leather
on its feet.

138
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,202
But what we're talking about
is much more complex than that.

139
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,045
- When did you take my wallet?
-You take Zumba?

140
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,844
It's actually a really good cardio workout.
Thank you very much.

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,650
You're thinking with your hands.

142
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,127
You gotta get inside the Vic's head.
Perceive from their perspective.

143
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,408
Human behavior is very predictable.

144
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,444
If I look at my hand,
it naturally pulls your gaze...

145
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,568
...and allows me to enter your space.

146
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,167
But when I look up at you,
it causes you to look directly at me.

147
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,366
Cute.

148
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,727
I touch you here, I steal from here.

149
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,451
I tap you here, I steal from here.

150
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,366
I step to here--

151
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,205
- You're not gonna slap my face, are you?
-Why?

152
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,488
You would if you knew
where my hand was.

153
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,487
Okay, I get it. I get it.

154
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,886
You get their focus...

155
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,963
...you can take whatever you want.

156
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,486
You be safe.

157
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,168
So why do I like this place?

158
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,601
Lots of space. Doesn't open
for a month or two.

159
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,526
We can tie into multiple lines, diffuse
our footprint, keep hopping DNS addresses.

160
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,286
Plus military-grade fiber.

161
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,523
How many bathrooms?
Fat-Ass Farhad is flying in.

162
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,162
- Two, coed. He still got irritable bowel?
-Yep.

163
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,209
Man, he should do a cleanse.

164
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,809
Horst, he is a 400-pound Persian.
He is not gonna do a cleanse.

165
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,924
Where you been staying? Hyatt again?

166
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,889
Yep. I love the brunch.

167
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,882
- You should stop by.
-No, no brunch. I'm doing a cleanse.

168
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,849
The horses are in the gate.

169
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,886
<i>And they're off!</i>

170
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,168
- Hyatt Rewards card, in my wallet.
- Admit that you're impressed.

171
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,164
I got your wallet and I found you
all the way down here.

172
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,483
Please. World Series, Final Four...

173
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,486
...the Sugar Bowl, Super Bowl,
any big event like this is sucker central.

174
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,251
Well, I still found you.
That's gotta count for something.

175
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,721
So how many Hyatts did you have to go to?

176
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,928
All three, five times each.

177
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,446
- I want in.
-Maybe I'm just here to watch the game.

178
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,001
I asked around who ran the game in Harlem.

179
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,006
The Limehouse Kid is your grandfather.
Bucky Spurgeon is your father.

180
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,804
"Father" is a very generous term.

181
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,281
And you're Nicky Spurgeon.
They call you "Mellow."

182
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,842
- I'm all crewed up, sweetie.
-Oh, come on. Please! Can we--?

183
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,246
Can we just--?

184
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,321
Can we skip the part where I speak
through thinly veiled allure...

185
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,882
...and lead you to believe there's some
earth-shattering hump in the works?

186
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,760
Because I suck at that kind of stuff.
I just want in.

187
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,810
- No earth-shattering hump in the works?
-No.

188
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,281
- I don't even get "thinly veiled allure"?
-No.

189
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,807
No baby voice? No lingering eye contact?

190
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,485
I am hopeless.

191
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,451
- That's all my favorite shit.
-I'm sorry.

192
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,410
Can I suggest that you learn?
Professionally.

193
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,684
Well, I mean, you could...

194
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,889
You could show me...

195
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,169
...in your room?

196
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,647
- That is so bad.
-Is it?

197
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,768
- Does it feel sexy on your face?
-A little.

198
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,008
It does. Okay, let's go.

199
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,640
- Wait, where are we go--? Wait, am I in?
-No.

200
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,081
- This is Horst.
-Hello, Jess.

201
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,924
- Hi.
-Nicky told me you were coming.

202
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,444
- You're such a dick.
Ha-ha-ha.

203
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,484
Yeah, he gets that a lot. Let's go.

204
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,125
What are you, a size 4?

205
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,880
Why do I have to wear this?

206
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,486
No one looks at your hands
when you got that working for you.

207
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,325
- I can't breathe.
- First, we stick to rich folks.

208
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,960
And no one with a cane
or a wheelchair, it's bad luck.

209
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,645
Tommy's the shade, Gareth's the stick.

210
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,610
All eyes on me until I make the mark.
Once I fan him, I tug my lapel.

211
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,287
Two fingers means it's a prat poke.
Three fingers means the leather's an insider.

212
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,602
If it's a cordeen or an ox tongue,
I'll scratch my nose.

213
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,525
Unless I use my thumb, which means
I am actually scratching my nose.

214
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,287
Left or right tail I'll cock my head,
but keister kicks are 95 percent of it.

215
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,683
So you just do the touch, and I ding
the poke in the nearest mailbox, okay?

216
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,840
I'm sorry, what?

217
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,002
Okay, plan B. You two, come with me.

218
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,926
Excuse me, please, we're so lost.

219
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,208
It was excellent. You wanna wire?

220
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,566
Let me wire.

221
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,610
Ponytail's your mark. Right bridge.
Right rear pocket.

222
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,925
My bad.

223
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,527
- That was nice.
- Okay. I got this.

224
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,449
- What?
-Give me some shade.

225
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,846
Wait.

226
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,282
Ooh! Oh. Sorry. My heel keeps--
You're such a gentleman.

227
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,371
Derrick knows how to treat a lady.
Married?

228
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,682
- Dude!
-Didn't mention that, did he?

229
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,047
All right. Thank you, boys.

230
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,600
<i>You're in.</i>

231
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,966
Really?

232
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,044
- Congratulations, you're a criminal.
-Okay, what now?

233
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,089
- Want me to do the primer?
-I got it.

234
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,523
There's a flight landing
every two minutes at Louis Armstrong.

235
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,251
Whoever's not here for the game's
here for the party.

236
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,687
Every one of them looking
to drink big, bet big...

237
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,730
...cheat on their spouses,
and it all costs money.

238
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,690
There are boost teams
at all the major hotels.

239
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,083
They hit quick and get out before
anybody ever knows what happened.

240
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,004
And if you think for one second...

241
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,448
...I'm gonna let your mother talk
to me like that, you are fucking crazy!

242
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,570
I'm a grown-ass man!

243
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,364
Why are you yelling at me?

244
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,764
<i>There's card games everywhere.</i>

245
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,968
<i>And they let anyone with enough cash in.</i>

246
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,851
<i>Chances are, at least one of those guys
you don't know...</i>

247
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,129
<i>...is a mechanic who can work a deck
like Bill Clinton works a crowd.</i>

248
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,925
All in.

249
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,486
Full boat.

250
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,846
I swear...

251
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,369
...I've never had four of a kind before! Ha!

252
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,603
Sorry, coach. I've never had four of a kind.
Hey, come on, coach.

253
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,128
- Motherfucker! What the fuck!
-You win some, you lose some, right?

254
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,363
That's it. Get the fuck out of here.
Come on, let's go. Move.

255
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,643
- Um, it's my husband!
<i>- I'll</i> kill you!

256
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,649
- Give me my pants!
-Go! No, just run!

257
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,006
Wait! Wait! Stop!

258
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,367
Baby! Stop! Baby!

259
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,528
Married guys are the best.
Who they gonna tell?

260
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,047
- I will kill you!
- It's my husband!

261
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,567
<i>Every minute there's something
going on down here.</i>

262
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,485
<i>Every bar, restaurant, hotel, everywhere.</i>

263
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,802
<i>Guys working alone, working in teams.</i>

264
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,081
<i>Not just cash either. Identity theft
and credit card spoofing are big too.</i>

265
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,722
<i>You can skim the data right off
a credit card in about a second.</i>

266
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,082
<i>But boosting a wallet
only gives you an hour...</i>

267
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,244
<i>...before the vic gets wise
and the cards are canceled.</i>

268
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,209
<i>So you put the card back.</i>

269
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,562
<i>By the time the mark gets wise,
he's in Youngstown arguing with his wife...</i>

270
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,491
<i>...over the charges we rack up
before the bill comes.</i>

271
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,691
A skimmer swipes the card
and records the keystrokes...

272
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,490
...so you can get the pin too.

273
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,926
Look, you see that?

274
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,084
Oh, wow, did he make that?

275
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,682
Yeah. A few years back
he replaced the credit card terminals...

276
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,366
...at about a dozen 99 Cent Stores in L.A.

277
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,285
Took down a few million
before they caught on.

278
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,444
What does a guy like that
do with that kind of money?

279
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,161
He, uh, financed his own line of gravies.

280
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,721
Uh, yeah, he just--
That's his seat. Just let him--

281
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,530
Oh, I'm sorry.

282
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,971
Who's the girl?

283
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,325
Her name is Jess, Farhad.

284
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,965
She's our intern.

285
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,731
Ah.

286
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,925
You're hitting that?

287
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,484
I'm right here.

288
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,325
- No, Farhad, I'm not hitting that.
-You should hit that.

289
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,609
Yeah. Hi. Still right here.

290
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,690
I'd totally hit that.

291
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,008
He's fucking with me, right?

292
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,161
Right?

293
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,727
- She talks a lot.
<i>- Smile.</i>

294
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,570
Thank you. I'll get this loaded in.

295
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,768
- Shouldn't take long.
- Get a digital camera.

296
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,764
So we're about 30 strong,
everybody gets a percentage.

297
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,845
We cover bribes and fall money for anybody
who gets pinched, knock wood.

298
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,047
We sell the ATM data
to a guy in Singapore.

299
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,406
The shopaholics here...

300
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,844
...buy merchandise which we overnight back
to ourselves and resell on the gray market.

301
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,764
Yesterday we bought 200 MacBook Airs.

302
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,410
Oh, my God.

303
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,643
That is incredible.

304
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,011
- Oh, do you think that maybe I--?
-No.

305
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,768
Sell everything. Take no chances.

306
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,602
So, what about the big con?

307
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,162
I thought you were all big time.

308
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,162
Oh, you mean the one
where we make so much money...

309
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,086
...we all retire and get yachts
and boob jobs.

310
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,926
Yeah, that's a fantasy.

311
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,890
We are in the volume business.
Safer that way.

312
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,570
Hey, Jen, I need a dime.
I got bit at the track.

313
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,366
Come on, girl.

314
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,280
Thank you, baby.

315
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,920
Clean card, clean ID,
everything you need.

316
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,606
Thank you.

317
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,008
Well, don't thank me yet.

318
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,801
Got a lot of work to do.
Tough week ahead.

319
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,246
I know.

320
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,771
So, what now?

321
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,086
There's a key card in there. Um...

322
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,129
I got you another place.

323
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,251
I think you'll like it.

324
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,090
Wow, thanks.

325
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,690
Do you know how I can get a cab there?

326
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,730
I can give you a ride.

327
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,450
Yeah? That'd <i>be</i> great. <i>I</i> mean...

328
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,329
<i>...if it's okay with you.</i>

329
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,970
<i>It's fine with me. Is it okay with you?</i>

330
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,251
Yeah.

331
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,760
<i>You sure?</i>

332
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,127
<i>You seem like a pretty good driver.</i>

333
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,324
<i>You can count on me.</i>

334
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,051
Can <i>l?</i>

335
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,164
<i>- Most would say no.
- Mmm.</i>

336
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,769
You seem trustworthy.

337
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,127
Maybe you should take that cab.

338
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,566
- Yeah.
-Okay.

339
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,529
- Okay.
-All right.

340
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,847
- Aw. Who's that?
-This is my little girl, Mina.

341
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,206
Cute.

342
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,603
- My son, Dani.
-Oh, that's sweet.

343
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,806
- That's my wife, Lida.
-Pretty.

344
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,610
That's my dick.

345
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,921
Cool.

346
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,411
- Sorry about that.
-That's okay.

347
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,642
- That's my dog.
-Aw.

348
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,006
Hate it.

349
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,211
So you've known, um--
You've known Nicky a long time?

350
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,249
Uh, ten years. Why?

351
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,689
I'm just wondering.

352
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,080
Okay, you got me.

353
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,402
- We're sleeping together, okay?
-Mm. Mm-hm.

354
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,847
- Like the ancient Greeks.
-Ha-ha-ha.

355
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,281
Actually, I don't know.
I mean, I like the guy, I do...

356
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,161
...but people aren't really his bag,
so it's hard to tell sometimes.

357
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,802
Yeah, I guess you can't blame him.
I mean, he told me about that thing...

358
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,008
...with his dad and his grandfather.

359
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,810
It was crazy.

360
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,085
He told you that?

361
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,971
I mean, I've heard that story,
but never from him.

362
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,281
Really?

363
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,324
- You must throw a mean one. Damn.
-Ha-ha.

364
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,768
I'm really gonna miss sucking his dick.

365
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,531
So's he.

366
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,565
Stop it.

367
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,960
- All right, you ready?
-Yep. Aah!

368
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,242
Frank? Frank!
Oh, my God, somebody help.

369
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,811
Please, please, somebody help.

370
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,321
Baby, we're getting you someone. Okay?
Just stay with me.

371
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,970
Stay with me, goddamn it.

372
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,646
Somebody get someone!
Somebody call a doctor.

373
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,810
Is there a doctor? I need a doctor.
Doctor, help me.

374
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,487
My husband's just had a heart attack.
I don't know what to do. I'm so worried.

375
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,682
Frank? Frank? Can you hear me?

376
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,481
- Oh, my God! Somebody call 911!
- Hey, Frank.

377
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,846
Frank!

378
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,521
Who was the cop with the wandering hands?

379
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,489
Oh, he was real.

380
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,320
He just stumbled in.

381
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,970
Who hits on a grieving widow?

382
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,682
I guess that's just how fantastic
you look in that dress.

383
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,524
What's a girl to do?

384
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,122
I can think of a couple things
she could do.

385
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,047
- Yeah, me too, actually.
- Mmm.

386
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,804
I think we should start with oral.

387
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,321
Just saying.
Come on, man, I'm right here.

388
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,686
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

389
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,043
Everybody! Everybody.
Everybody, everybody.

390
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,884
Can I get your attention?

391
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,611
Uh...

392
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,888
- What you laughing at?
Ha-ha-ha.

393
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,409
Record-setting week.

394
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,807
And I wanna say congratulations
to you all.

395
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,724
After expenses...

396
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,042
...$1.2 million.

397
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,446
Great work, great work.

398
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,570
After the big game's over tomorrow,
this place gets bleached down.

399
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,326
Anything not nailed to the floor
goes in the incinerator.

400
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,608
Horst here has all of your travel money.

401
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,491
Once you get home,
I will wire you all your cuts.

402
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,691
Thank you, guys, really.

403
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,609
- To Nicky.
- To Nicky!

404
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,610
Nicky!

405
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,171
No, no, no. Farhad, not Forehead.

406
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,209
- What's that mean?
- Doesn't matter.

407
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,045
Stay juicy.

408
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,603
That's all of it, 1.2?

409
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,967
Do not let it leave your sight.
You promise?

410
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,361
- Uh, yeah, I promise.
-No dogs or ponies.

411
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,760
<i>Hey-</i>

412
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,288
- How long have you known me?
- No, just look. Look at me. Man to man.

413
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,646
No gambling, okay?

414
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,961
Yes, dear.

415
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,970
I'll see you when I see you.

416
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,882
You guys are so cute.

417
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,971
I'm tired.

418
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,728
Okay. Wanna go to the game tomorrow?

419
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,565
You have tickets?

420
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,042
Of course. It's one of the perks
of the business.

421
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,406
Oh, uh--

422
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,642
Did you mean these tickets?

423
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,610
Okay, you're gonna need
to stop that, all right?

424
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,643
- Stop showing off.
-Ha-ha-ha.

425
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,286
- An exit interview?
- Yes.

426
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,602
- Oh, my God. Are you serious?
-Tell me.

427
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,444
So you mean like, uh:

428
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,688
"Jess is a hard worker,
honest and prompt.

429
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,050
I believe she'll be a valuable asset
to your team at Sizzler of San Bernardino."

430
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,441
No, not a reference, you dick.

431
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,443
Criticism. Constructive criticism.

432
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,443
Uh, really?

433
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,523
- Are you serious?
-Yes.

434
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,406
Okay.

435
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,886
Okay.

436
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,362
You got a light touch.

437
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,851
You know, you're kind of invisible out there.

438
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,564
And you're calm.

439
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,365
You know, you get upside down,
you don't panic. You adjust.

440
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,324
You actually rally...

441
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,487
...when the going gets tough,
which is rare.

442
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,806
And I been in this...

443
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,049
...for a really, really long time.

444
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,561
And I've never seen anything like you.

445
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,206
Thank you.

446
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,688
But I was actually talking about the sex.

447
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,689
Please, there's a thousand hos
better than you.

448
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,690
Whoa! Please!
I can't believe you said that!

449
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,969
You're just laying there. You know?
I'm like, "Come on, is this thing on?"

450
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,087
- You're mean.
-Mm.

451
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,204
- Why Mellow?
-Hm?

452
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,243
Why do they call you Mellow?

453
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,845
Oh. Yeah, you know,
I don't like that name.

454
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,370
I know, but why do they call you that?

455
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,525
Oh, my dad just started calling me that.

456
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,406
And?

457
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,290
And I don't like it.

458
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,128
Ow. Ow!

459
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,720
My dad, he said, um...

460
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,846
...there's two kinds of people in this world.

461
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,004
There's hammers and nails.

462
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,323
You decide which one you wanna be.

463
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,123
He said there's no room for heart
in this game.

464
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,249
That shit'll get you killed.

465
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,170
He, uh...

466
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,890
He said I was soft.

467
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,006
So he started calling me marshmallow.

468
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,648
- Mellow.
-Yeah.

469
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,731
You're a big old marshmallow, you are.

470
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,565
Mm-mm.

471
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,291
I'm gonna get some more wine.
Do you want some?

472
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,887
- Nope, I'm good.
-Okay.

473
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,491
Where are we going?

474
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,162
How did you get these tickets?

475
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,051
Just one of the many wonderful things
about being me.

476
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,329
<i>This Hall of Famer is</i>
a <i>three-time champion MVP with Chicago.</i>

477
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,087
<i>Let's give a Superdome welcome
to Billy Canady.</i>

478
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,880
<i>Brevings on the kick
for the Miami Threshers.</i>

479
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,249
Is this a bad time to mention
I don't really like football?

480
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,605
Yeah. Like the worst time possible.

481
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,281
I'm sorry. It just seems like a lot
of standing around all the time.

482
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,686
Are you kidding?

483
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,251
Don't you think? I--

484
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,330
Well, you were really excited
about the tickets.

485
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,882
No, I am. I'm so excited.
I just don't get the game.

486
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,930
Okay, I get it. All right. Um...

487
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,284
You know what? Forget football.
We can still have fun. All right.

488
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,966
Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs right here!

489
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,123
- Let me get one.
- Right there.

490
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,846
I will bet you $1 that that guy
does not catch that hot dog.

491
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,206
- Down there?
-Yep.

492
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,930
Okay.

493
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,725
Oh.

494
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,405
How did you know that?

495
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,284
Because that guy cannot throw.

496
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,171
He knocked this old lady's glasses off
about 10 minutes ago.

497
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,163
Okay. Okay. Ooh.

498
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,043
- Okay, um...
- Whoo!

499
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,771
Down there. Shirtless guy
with the body paint.

500
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,048
Ten says he's too drunk
to get up for the wave.

501
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,766
- Are you sure? His team is on a drive.
-Are you in or out?

502
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,570
- I'm in.
-Okay.

503
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,726
Don't do it.

504
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,127
-Yes!
-Really?

505
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,725
- Really?
-I know my drunks.

506
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,322
So you're a fan?
You're considering yourself a fan?

507
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,245
Thank you! Okay. We're even now.

508
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,368
- All right. Hold on, no, no. A tiebreaker.
-Okay.

509
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,366
Um, okay. <i>Mamita</i> with the short shorts.

510
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,846
- Oh, yeah.
-See her?

511
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,686
How many guys are gonna look at her ass
as she walks up the aisle?

512
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,046
Closest one wins.

513
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,123
- End seats only?
-End seats only.

514
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,163
- At least eight.
-Eight?

515
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,362
- Mm-hm.
-Three.

516
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,885
Five.

517
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,646
Can I get in on this?

518
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,841
Sure, 10 bucks, Mr...?

519
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,520
Liyuan. I say five guys look. Sure thing.

520
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,966
Okay.

521
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,566
There's one.

522
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,051
- Two.
- Yeah.

523
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,406
- Three.
-Three.

524
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,210
- Four. Sorry.
-I'm out. I'm done.

525
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,205
Five.

526
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,044
- And it's six.
-Come on.

527
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,885
Six.

528
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,971
Seven! Yes!

529
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,249
I'm the closest! I know my leches too.

530
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,646
Money, money, money.

531
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,370
Okay, okay.

532
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,841
I want justice. I want my money back.
Make another bet.

533
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,048
- Okay.
-I want my change.

534
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,327
Okay. Which team draws the next penalty?

535
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,006
I don't know football. You boys play.

536
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,489
Okay. Defense.

537
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,320
How much?

538
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,684
- One thousand.
-Ooh.

539
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,920
Yeah.

540
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,245
I'll do the thousand.

541
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,441
We have holding! Number 77!
On the offense.

542
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,330
- Ten-yard penalty.
-Yes!

543
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,891
Okay, 5000.

544
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,770
Do they pass or run?

545
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,207
- Five thousand.
-Oh, wow.

546
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,125
- He's been drinking. Definitely.
-He is... Yeah.

547
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,486
I have.

548
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,442
- Okay. You call it.
-They run.

549
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,886
They run.

550
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,970
Three-18! Hut!

551
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,284
Yeah!

552
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,522
They run, they run! Yeah!

553
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,210
Ooh. Ouch.

554
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,170
Yeah. Ouch is right. Ouch is right.

555
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,920
- On that note, I'm gonna get a drink.
-Yeah. Me too.

556
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,005
- Double or nothing. Your bet.
-No, I'm good, man. Thank you.

557
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,845
No. Easy bet. Easy bet.
They make this kick, you win.

558
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,606
Good odds, huh? They always make
this kick. You can't lose.

559
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,842
Come on, I want to play.

560
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,569
I like you.

561
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,210
You can't lose.

562
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,483
Oh, come on, I want to play.

563
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,962
- How much?
-Double or nothing, 10,000.

564
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,124
Oh, too much?

565
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,883
All right, 10 grand.

566
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,449
Three-42! Hut!

567
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,320
- Really?
- Oh, no.

568
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,323
I'm sorry.

569
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,006
I'm sorry. I'm such a lucky guy.

570
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,165
Maybe we should just get going.

571
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,084
Come on. All right. Ahem.

572
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,730
Wait, hold up. Hold up.

573
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,086
Fifty.

574
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,364
- Say again?
-Fifty grand.

575
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,410
Nicky.
- it's all right. Okay?

576
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,050
- Okay.
-Relax.

577
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,045
Um, he's not gonna return the kick.

578
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,530
On the kickoff he'll take a knee. Ahem.

579
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,131
Ah.

580
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,090
Now you make things interesting.

581
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,240
Okay.

582
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,360
Okay.

583
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,083
Okay. We good?

584
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,401
- Nicky?
-Relax.

585
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,927
- Wow. Oh.
-it's okay.

586
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,321
-It's okay.
-All right. Hold it, hold on.

587
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,768
Give me one second. Give me a second.
Give me a second. Give me a second.

588
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,406
A hundred grand.

589
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,009
One hundred thousand.

590
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,400
Yep.

591
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,851
You don't have 100,000.

592
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,921
Yeah, I do.

593
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,762
You can't do that.

594
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,406
Next play. Pass incomplete.

595
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,243
I say he catches it.

596
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,005
Wow.

597
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,290
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

598
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,324
We're going.

599
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,326
We're going.

600
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,846
All of it.

601
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,845
- One-point-one million.
- Nicky.

602
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,843
Nicky, that is my money too.

603
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,360
High card takes it all.

604
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,690
You are crazy.

605
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,643
I like it.

606
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,366
After you.

607
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,010
Thank you.

608
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,566
What is that you said, tomo ha <i>de?</i>
What's that?

609
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,960
It's just an expression.

610
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,360
It's hard to explain.

611
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,890
Rough translation's...

612
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,084
am fucked."

613
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,963
I'm sorry, friend. That's what happens
when you play with the big boys.

614
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,647
Oh, fuck me.

615
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,091
Double it.

616
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,329
- Oh, man. Dude, what are you doing?
-I'm good for it.

617
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,320
Double it.

618
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,082
You got a problem, my friend.

619
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,444
Take those binoculars.
Pick any player on or off the field.

620
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,931
And I will guess the number.

621
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,285
Any player?

622
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,169
That's like 100-to-1.

623
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,287
It's good odds for you. Two million.

624
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,928
That's fucking crazy.

625
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,685
I don't like it.

626
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,846
Okay. Okay. I'll sweeten it for you.

627
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,004
You pick the player.

628
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,843
And she'll guess the number.

629
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,646
What?

630
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,122
You're fucking crazy.

631
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,530
But I can't turn down free money.

632
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,769
You got a bet.

633
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,608
Ha-ha. Alvin.

634
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,201
What are you doing?

635
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,249
Don't drag me into this.

636
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,882
What, it's not enough you lost
everyone's money? My money?

637
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,883
Ugh, she sounds like my wife.

638
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,566
Get your hands off me. You're sick.

639
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,047
- Hey, come on. Wait, wait.
-Don't put your hands on her.

640
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,561
- What the hell is your problem?
-Steven, stop! Bah-bah-bah.

641
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,643
Tell him to keep his damn hands to himself!

642
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,168
I understand. I understand. I am sorry.
He has gotten carried away.

643
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,244
He likes pretend he is the Kevin Costner
and I am the Whitney Houston.

644
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,561
- The hell!
-Steven.

645
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,121
Please. He just knows
that I want to play.

646
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,605
Let's Play.

647
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,924
Look at me. Hey.

648
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,970
Please, don't make me do this, Nicky. Please.

649
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,843
- Just pick.
-Don't make me do this.

650
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,082
- Jess.
-Just let me go.

651
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,605
Just do it.

652
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,330
Pick a fucking player.

653
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,250
Please, don't make me
do this, Nicky. Please.

654
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,646
Please.

655
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,845
Okay.

656
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,250
I got one.

657
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,688
Do you want me to write it down?

658
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,285
No, I trust you.

659
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,526
Nicky.

660
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,969
Then it's her turn.

661
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,611
Just do it. Pick.

662
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,408
Pick a fucking player.

663
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,323
He's crazy, I know. But it will be his fault.

664
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,205
Not yours.

665
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,970
Team, let's go!

666
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,401
Don't take a chance!
Fair catch if you have to!

667
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,768
Set up to run! Let's go!

668
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,167
I don't know. I don't--

669
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,007
Look. I give you one chance
to back down, okay?

670
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,844
No hard feelings.

671
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,330
Pick.

672
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,330
Wow.

673
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,000
I guess...

674
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,371
I guess number...

675
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,451
Wait.

676
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,924
Number 55.

677
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,165
No.

678
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,285
No.

679
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:06,088
No, no, no, no fucking way!

680
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,210
That is unbelievable!
How did you do that?

681
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,566
I'm right?

682
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,721
- Fuck!
-Am I right?

683
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,360
- Yes! You're fucking right!
- I'm right?

684
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,761
- Fucking shit! You're fucking right.
-Oh, my God.

685
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,564
- That is great.
-You're not mad?

686
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,491
- No fucking way! I'm not-- Mwah. --mad.
-No?

687
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,928
We have got to go to Vegas.
Right now. I have a jet.

688
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,082
Oh, that was incredible.

689
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,004
Did you see what she just did?

690
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,041
And, you. You. Oh, you have got
some big fucking balls.

691
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,090
You are my new fucking hero.

692
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,410
- Double or nothing?
-No! No fucking way!

693
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,404
Get the fuck out of my suite! Now!

694
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,450
Yeah! First down, baby! First down!

695
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,931
We're good! We're good!

696
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,565
We're good, coach.

697
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,850
Consider your debt settled.

698
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,966
I am going to kill you.

699
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,451
Kill me later.

700
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,640
I'm going to kill you!

701
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,168
- What?
-You did great. You did great.

702
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,964
Oh, my God.

703
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,489
How did you do that?

704
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,484
Liyuan Tse. Legendary gambler.

705
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,565
He bets on everything. Anything.
Huge cash bets, all the time.

706
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,690
Once the Bellagio put Bill Gates
out of the high-roller's suite...

707
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,171
...because Liyuan was flying in.

708
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,129
He is the perfect vic.

709
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,291
But how did you know
who he was gonna pick?

710
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,605
We told him to.

711
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,484
We been telling him all day.

712
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,327
<i>From the moment he left
his hotel room, we've been priming him.</i>

713
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,403
<i>Programming his subconscious.</i>

714
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,082
<i>He's been seeing the number 55
all day long.</i>

715
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,165
<i>On the elevator. In the lobby.</i>

716
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,488
<i>Even the stick pin on the doorman.</i>

717
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,606
<i>Not only that, we loaded his route
from the hotel to the stadium.</i>

718
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,845
<i>He looks out the window,
primers are everywhere.</i>

719
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,842
<i>Now, he doesn't see it, but he does.</i>

720
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,727
<i>There's no getting around it.</i>

721
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,523
<i>He even sees Farhad.</i>

722
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,162
I'm trying to drive, you Rhino bitch!
Fuck the Rhinos! Fuck the Rhi--

723
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,731
Suggestions are everywhere.

724
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,008
From the number of flowers in a vase...

725
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,881
...to the tramp stamp on the hooker
we sent to his room last night.

726
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,770
That is genius.

727
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,730
Yeah. And it's not only what he sees.
It's what he hears.

728
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,044
<i>The Mandarin word for "five" is woo.</i>

729
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,687
<i>There are 124 "woo-woos"
in "Sympathy for the Devil."</i>

730
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,763
<i>Now, he's not registering it,
but it's all there.</i>

731
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,927
<i>So when he picks up those binoculars,
looks out on the field...</i>

732
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,243
<i>...sees a familiar face
with the number 55 on his jersey...</i>

733
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,086
<i>...some tittie voice in the back
"That's it."</i>

734
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,925
<i>And he thinks it's intuition. And he picks.</i>

735
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,208
Do you want me to write it down?

736
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,329
<i>And you, being in the dark,
was the convincer.</i>

737
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,851
<i>We call that the "Little Blind Mouse."</i>

738
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,681
I'm the "Blind Mouse"?

739
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,888
You're such an asshole.

740
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,761
You can't tell me that's 100-percent real.

741
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,410
Well, it's probabilistic.

742
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,608
Farhad has it at about 59 percent...

743
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,603
...but it's better than Vegas.

744
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,362
And what if he picked wrong?

745
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,570
Double it till it happens.

746
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,131
That's amazing.

747
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,411
You're amazing.

748
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,611
Nicky!

749
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,286
What's wrong?

750
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,365
You did great.

751
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,291
Okay.

752
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,526
What's going on? Why are we pulling over?

753
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,646
Nicky?

754
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,084
What is this?

755
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,480
It's 80.

756
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,965
The job is over.

757
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,731
You did great.

758
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,524
You're kidding, right?

759
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,325
You're...?

760
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,326
Take her to the airport.

761
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,404
I'm not going to the airport.
Wait, can you just talk to me?

762
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,444
- I'm sorry. You did great. You did great.
-Nicky? What's going on?

763
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,840
Answer me!

764
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,645
Nicky!

765
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,600
Shit.

766
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,171
I wasn't expecting such a kind face.

767
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,607
The tech says his gizmo checks out.

768
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,128
But in all candor, I don't like this.

769
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,887
And I don't like him.

770
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,286
Why?

771
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,289
He's a con man, sir.

772
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,451
That's the point.

773
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,568
I keep my Beretta well-fed.

774
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,244
Owens. Why do you have to be so dramatic?

775
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,051
Invite him to lunch.

776
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,809
You are a man known for great skills
of persuasion and deception.

777
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,371
You were very hard for me to find.

778
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,960
- Why did you take my offer?
-Went broke.

779
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,446
My car.

780
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,568
Forty million euro in R&D, easily.

781
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,447
McEwen, Rahal, Lotus...

782
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,604
Any team in any class,
they spend half of that.

783
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,003
But I have something none of them have.

784
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,003
- A fuel-burn algorithm.
-Yes.

785
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,650
The EXR.

786
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,251
They all want it.

787
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,211
It's legal.

788
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,445
And my engineers promise
it guarantees me a win.

789
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,325
That's not enough for me.

790
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,721
This year McEwen is the only team
standing in my way.

791
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,086
That is why I wanted you.

792
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,324
- 80--
This needs to be discreet.

793
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,801
It needs to be safe. No holes.

794
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,205
I will pose as a disgruntled
team engineer of yours...

795
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,325
...offering to sell the EXR to McEwen.

796
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,323
What I will give him is a fake.

797
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,769
It doesn't really do anything, just gives
false readings to their instruments.

798
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:11,005
It will mislead the driver enough
that you'll have a slight added edge.

799
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,561
A third of a second every few laps.
imperceptible.

800
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,121
Just because the techs say
that it checks out...

801
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:20,245
...what makes you think you can
convince them that you're absolutely real?

802
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,971
That you're-- That you're totally authentic?

803
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,203
You can't be clicking around here, boy.

804
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,641
You don't need to worry about me.
I'm extremely well researched.

805
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,408
We'll proceed as planned,
starting at the kickoff party tonight.

806
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,562
- Okay.
<i>- I'll</i> be seen drinking...

807
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,242
...and boisterous and disgruntled.

808
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,847
I will approach you in full view of McEwen.

809
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,571
An argument will ensue,
I will throw my drink...

810
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,690
...I will shove you, if that's okay with you?

811
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,921
It's okay.

812
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,050
I'd be very surprised if McEwen
didn't approach me right there...

813
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,931
...but if not, I will contact him.
-Good.

814
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,971
Whatever he's willing to pay me,
I will be keeping 100 percent for myself...

815
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,363
...on top of the 1 million from you.
-Do we have a deal?

816
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,249
Yes, Mr. Garriga, we have a deal.

817
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,640
That's great.

818
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,524
- Appreciate your time. I'll see you tonight.
-Thank you.

819
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,124
Don't say I didn't warn you.

820
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,286
Drama.

821
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,166
I'm excited.

822
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,766
That's right.

823
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,610
Do you speak English?

824
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:15,163
Yes, absolutely. Yeah, but you speak
good Spanish. Oh, yes.

825
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,004
Oh, why, thank you, thank you. Um...

826
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,844
Look, I'm here tonight for business.

827
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,685
And I am a recovering alcoholic.

828
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,162
So when I ask you for a vodka martini
on the rocks...

829
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,648
...if you could give me water with olives
that would be fantastic.

830
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,482
- Great decision, sir. Wise.
-Thank you.

831
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,047
And the thing is, I don't even drink.

832
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,964
That man got me drinking again.

833
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,282
- Vodka martini on the rocks.
-On the rocks.

834
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,842
I wonder if "Garriga" is Spanish for "thief."

835
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,889
Oh, my God, what a drinker!

836
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,203
Who the fuck put a couch full of women
in the middle of this place?

837
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,881
<i>Hey!</i>

838
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,044
Where are the black people?!

839
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,522
There he is, right there,
the Commander in Thief!

840
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,889
But I guess you can do what you want
when you're a rich prick!

841
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,849
Maybe you should slow down a little.

842
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,686
No, no, no. I just wanna talk to the man.
This is a free country.

843
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,529
- Buenos Aires is a free country, right? Okay.
-No, Buenos Aires is a city.

844
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,205
I'm gonna go over there.

845
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,566
Hey!

846
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,566
Hey!

847
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,200
- Well, hello.
-Hey.

848
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,250
Hello.

849
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,050
God, it's been a long time.

850
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,200
So you...?

851
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,646
You're here with, uh...?

852
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,040
- Rafael?
-Yeah.

853
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,204
Yeah, he, um--
He owns one of the teams, so...

854
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,520
Is he a mark?

855
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,445
No. We're together.

856
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,284
Have been for a long time.

857
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:11,324
I'm out of the game.

858
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,168
Jess, um...

859
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,489
All right. Uh, about New Orleans,
and just...

860
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:27,771
Oh, Nicky. No.
I really don't need an explanation.

861
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,969
I mean, if anything, I should be
thanking you. You did me a favor.

862
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,490
Well, that's fantastic.

863
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,890
He's probably wondering where I am.

864
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,130
Take care of yourself, okay?

865
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,930
You too. Be well.

866
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,124
Um, Nicky.

867
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,251
He doesn't know about my past, so...

868
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,010
...you don't know me.

869
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,846
Okay?

870
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,686
Okay.

871
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,842
- Thank you.
-You're welcome.

872
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,084
Alcohol.

873
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,171
Can I get a vodka, please?

874
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,646
Sure.

875
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,806
This is water.

876
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,490
No, sir, it's vodka.

877
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,005
It's water.

878
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,286
Sir, I know who you are.

879
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:30,047
Marcello told me about you
and your condition, so back off.

880
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,365
All right, you're kidding.

881
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,405
Are you drunk?

882
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,763
Mr. Garriga is not a guy you wanna cross.

883
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,891
Me neither.

884
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:09,566
Now just what part of the plan calls
for a tray full of appletinis?

885
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,528
Pledging a sorority?

886
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,049
Mm. I'm just rethinking the plan a little bit.

887
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:21,369
Goddamn prima-donna
delicate-science bullshit.

888
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,246
You are not splitting atoms here, pal.
This ain't CERN.

889
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,086
Just do what you're being paid to do.
Shitheel.

890
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,691
Hey!

891
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,691
Garriga!

892
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,281
Oh, God.

893
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,125
Don't worry, it's just a disgruntled engineer.

894
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,648
I expect you have something to say to me.

895
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,290
- Ow!
-Oh, my God.

896
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,805
Oh, shit.

897
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,602
- Why are you punching?
-You stole from me!

898
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,205
Nobody steals from me!

899
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:12,160
I am such a disgruntled engineer!

900
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,930
- Get him out of here!
-Yes, sir.

901
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,401
Out! Get out!

902
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,130
Oversold it a bit, didn't you?

903
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:19,970
I was just caught up in the moment.

904
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,049
Ah! Get him out.

905
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,526
Get rid of him.

906
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,808
It's okay. I'm good.

907
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,606
Go back to the party.

908
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,764
- Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

909
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,450
What the hell was that?

910
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,003
The racing business, cariï¿½o.

911
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,491
- Jesus.
-That's all.

912
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,165
Wait a minute.

913
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,005
You can't throw me out.
I'm staying in this hotel.

914
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,003
Let me see your keys.

915
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,004
Thank you.

916
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,689
Mr. McEwen would like to have lunch.

917
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,604
Information is on the card.

918
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,088
I still got it.

919
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,804
You ever heard of Udo Pappenphus?

920
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,082
- What the fuck are you looking at?
-Nothing.

921
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:32,886
I'm sorry, I'm--

922
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:37,728
Udo Pappenphus was an engineer
for Ferrari for many years. Fucking brilliant.

923
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,645
One day, Udo Pappenphus was found
behind a berm with his throat cut.

924
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,686
Udo...

925
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,081
...he was that prick Garriga's man.

926
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,130
I want 3 million euro.

927
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,645
Well, fuck. Jesus.

928
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,725
It's the EXR.

929
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,484
EXR.

930
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,891
You're Father-fucking-Christmas to me, mate.

931
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,084
I'm gonna need to see some proof.

932
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,729
You understand? Proof.

933
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,770
- What the fuck are you looking at, mate?
-Nothing. Just repeat what you said.

934
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,604
What, the pool go Euro?

935
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,605
Gordon!

936
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,003
Get me fucking field glasses, mate.
They're on the thing.

937
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,208
Oh, yeah. She is a beauty.

938
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,721
- I love these race skanks.
-She's not a race skank.

939
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,929
Course she's a fucking race skank.
Town's lousy with them.

940
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,567
- Can we get back to business? Please.
-She's a little small on top for my taste.

941
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,449
One man's small
is another man's perfection.

942
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,207
It's like a "breasts are
a subjective opinion" topic.

943
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,964
Maybe if you're booking a fashion show.

944
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,282
I'm talking
about fucking slapping balls, mate.

945
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,090
Do you want the thing or not?

946
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,124
I'm gonna need to see proof.

947
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,123
I'll contact you.

948
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,482
- A Spritz, por favor.
-Okay.

949
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,848
And a vodka and cranberry, please.

950
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,087
Hey, you need to put some clothes on.

951
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,806
Excuse me?

952
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,122
There's Australian people here.

953
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,127
- What is that supposed to mean?
-I'm just saying, Jess.

954
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,931
They shipped all those people
down there for a reason.

955
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,246
Okay.

956
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,606
Whoa, what--?

957
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,410
You don't know me, remember?

958
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,766
Oh.

959
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,608
And what was that last night?

960
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,007
Was that about me?

961
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,843
Please. No.

962
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,169
Are you working an angle on Rafael?

963
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,845
No, Jess. I'm working for him.

964
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,162
But I wouldn't trust him if I were you.

965
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,163
But I should trust you?

966
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,529
- All right, Jess. Okay.
-That's interesting.

967
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,886
Come on.

968
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:45,967
Nicky, if Rafael sees us together,
I don't know what's gonna happen, okay?

969
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:49,806
He's the jealous type.
You need to stay away from me.

970
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,845
Fuck Rafael.

971
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,606
And, Nicky?

972
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,285
You're still an easy lift.

973
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,523
Stop touching my shit, Jess.

974
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,367
- Well?
-Looks credible.

975
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,725
Three million, eh?

976
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,086
Yes, sir.

977
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,050
I can have the complete package
in 48 hours.

978
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,362
Codes, documentation and analysis.

979
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,130
No worries, mate. No worries.

980
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,691
So, what's next?

981
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,330
Wait for my call.

982
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,050
Thank you.

983
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,325
Sefior Garriga's assistant called. She pulled
a few things she said you might like.

984
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,686
Great.

985
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,004
Sorry-- Miss?

986
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,761
You... You forgot...

987
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,044
...your bag.

988
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,567
You really should be more aware.

989
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,966
Oh, God. Seriously?

990
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,243
- Malbec?
-Yes, it is.

991
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,290
Where'd you learn that?

992
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,965
It's all they drink here.

993
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,124
And it says it on the label.

994
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,931
You know, Nicky, I've been thinking
about all this.

995
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,286
And?

996
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,485
And, um...

997
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,806
Nicky.

998
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:52,846
Let me have it.

999
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,561
Nicky, if we just ran. If we just-- You know,
if I could slip away or if we could--

1000
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,006
Yes.

1001
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,328
- Can we just--?
-Whatever. Yes.

1002
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,205
I can't.

1003
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,004
I can't, I'm sorry.

1004
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,491
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, Jess.

1005
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:15,004
Whatever you want.
I can keep you safe.

1006
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,607
- Nicky.
-Come on, Jess.

1007
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,211
Nicky, you taught me so much.

1008
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,681
But I've learned a lot since then.

1009
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,490
And I'd really...

1010
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,927
...like to show you all the things I've learned.

1011
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,520
Like how I learned how to play men.

1012
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,488
Like I just played you.

1013
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,088
- How's it feel?
-Wow.

1014
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:57,368
- Yeah. Wow.
-Ah.

1015
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,330
I think you're losing it. That was pathetic.

1016
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,891
"I'll keep you safe"?

1017
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,326
What was that?

1018
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,363
Does that work? Does that get you laid?

1019
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,404
- Hey, that was not a line.
-I'm not falling for your shit again.

1020
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,050
- Don't... Ah.
-Okay?

1021
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,725
And I'm very happy-

1022
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,565
So stay away from me.

1023
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,206
Nice ass-o.

1024
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,408
Nice ass. Nice ass.

1025
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,321
Very nice, very nice.

1026
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,364
Hey. Let's get a steak.

1027
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,842
- A steak? It's 9 in the morning.
-Take that up with God.

1028
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,365
How was the flight?

1029
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:48,086
Jesus Christ. They had me squeezed
between two fat guys.

1030
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:52,731
It sounds like you're complaining and you
shouldn't be, because I'm giving you a cut.

1031
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,564
All right, where's this going down?

1032
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,610
- You got the piece?
-it's in my bag.

1033
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,922
Can you get it? I'm too fat to reach it.

1034
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,451
Watch this.

1035
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,011
Nothing but net.

1036
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,210
- Ah, fuck, you all right?
-Yeah.

1037
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,566
You all right?

1038
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,650
Hey there.

1039
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:26,961
Farhad?

1040
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,686
Hi! How are you?

1041
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:34,767
God, look at you.
You've lost so much weight.

1042
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:35,967
I did a cleanse.

1043
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,963
- You here with Nicky?
-Sort of.

1044
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,407
- Do you mind?
-Please.

1045
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,443
You must be turned on
by all these women.

1046
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,967
- I suppose.
-You do more than suppose.

1047
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:50,167
What does that mean?

1048
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,010
- Oh, dear God.
-I'm just saying.

1049
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:56,642
Please, never make that face again.
I don't even wanna know what that means.

1050
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,605
- Oh, I think we do. Heh-heh.
-I think we don't.

1051
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,167
Everybody knows you're a lesbian.
It's completely fine.

1052
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,846
- Who knows I'm a lesbian?
-it's especially fine to me.

1053
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,971
- Where are you getting this from?
-Every other time you speak, I smell a vagina.

1054
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,600
-It's not true.
-That's not a bad thing, believe me.

1055
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:12,966
Oh, Jesus.

1056
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,531
Okay, all right.

1057
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,843
Listen, you got Nicky all nuts.

1058
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,331
- I do? Good.
-Yeah.

1059
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:28,087
I've never seen him like this. You know,
he's barely worked since New Orleans.

1060
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,846
Seriously?

1061
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:33,051
I know he's an asshole.
I mean, a really big asshole.

1062
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,964
- Yeah.
-He should've handled it better.

1063
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,851
But he's my friend,
and I'm gonna bat for him.

1064
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,365
So can you give him a break?

1065
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,491
I don't care what Nicky told you.
I'm not falling for this shit.

1066
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,330
I don't think you got that right.

1067
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,290
He seems different now,
and I've known him a long time.

1068
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,480
How do I know that?

1069
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,451
What is that?

1070
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,806
It's an orange.

1071
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,528
He kept it for you all this time.

1072
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,571
Mini-market!

1073
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,406
Shit.

1074
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:20,371
- That looks nice. Hm.
-I can't believe you kept it.

1075
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:22,525
Or found it.

1076
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,845
Or replicated it.

1077
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,411
- Ha-ha-ha.
-I don't know with you.

1078
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,767
- No, I kept it.
-Thank you.

1079
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,164
So Farhad said you didn't work
for a long time.

1080
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:36,609
Yeah, a couple years. Just didn't feel right.

1081
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,443
I even reached out to my dad.

1082
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,840
I hadn't seen him in years.

1083
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,844
I asked him if he'd ever gone
straight before. "Of course.

1084
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,764
I go straight every time I'm on parole.

1085
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,241
- Oh.
-Now drink a cup of concrete. Man up."

1086
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,243
- Solid advice.
-Yes.

1087
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:51,606
- Mm.
- Heh-heh.

1088
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,125
How's that working out?

1089
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:56,011
Well, thought I was ready to work.

1090
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,210
Then the girl walked in.

1091
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,727
Why are you going to all this trouble, Nicky?

1092
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,969
What do you want from me?

1093
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,167
I can convince anyone of anything.

1094
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,884
I once convinced a man that an empty
warehouse was the Federal Reserve.

1095
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,565
- So I'm good.
-Yeah.

1096
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,926
You're the best.

1097
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,320
But what I really want...

1098
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,729
...is to tell you that I've changed.

1099
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,008
And tell you that I am sorry.

1100
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,482
And I just want you to believe me.

1101
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,761
You know I want to believe you.
I want to believe you.

1102
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:50,966
I'm different now.

1103
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,528
I have to be getting back.

1104
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,284
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

1105
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,365
You all right?

1106
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,727
- What happened?
-I don't wanna talk about it.

1107
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,888
- Did he do something to you?
-No.

1108
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,361
Jess, did he put his hands on you?

1109
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,526
- Tell me what happened.
-Just-- Just kiss me.

1110
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,724
I have to leave soon.

1111
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,683
I want you to come with me.

1112
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,641
I know you think you love him.

1113
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:18,686
But...

1114
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,006
...I want you to come with me tonight.

1115
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,165
I don't love him.

1116
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,651
I just-- But I--

1117
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,683
But you can't trust me.

1118
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,171
I understand that.

1119
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,320
If you come with me,
we'll figure it out.

1120
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,086
I want--

1121
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,522
It's Owens. I gotta take it.

1122
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,126
Yeah.

1123
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:56,845
- Where are you?
- I'm in my room.

1124
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,684
<i>Good. I'm at the door.</i>

1125
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,485
He's at the do-- Uh--

1126
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:02,880
- All right. Um...
-What?

1127
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,286
Damn, you should've ma--

1128
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,729
All right, uh, give me a sec.

1129
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,685
We're good, just--

1130
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,882
Ugh. I'll get rid of him.

1131
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:13,326
<i>Hey-</i>

1132
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,689
You're still sleeping? I thought
you were meeting with McEwen.

1133
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,490
I am. Later.

1134
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:28,966
There's a lazy Sunday softness
to your generation.

1135
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,327
Makes me uncomfortable.

1136
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,883
I like to be on my feet.

1137
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:36,641
I'll lie down when I get cancer.

1138
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,245
Or if I fuck.

1139
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,724
Both of which will be done on my back,
in case you were wondering.

1140
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,724
Um, no, actually, I wasn't wondering.

1141
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,723
But thank you for sharing that.

1142
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:51,242
Sarcasm. Another pillar of your generation.

1143
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,131
You wanna tell somebody to fuck off,
tell them to fuck off.

1144
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,044
Don't say, "Gee, what a great jacket."

1145
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,690
It's weakness.

1146
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,842
That is a messy bed.

1147
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,404
Yeah, I don't sleep well.

1148
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,841
- Someone here, son?
- Who you calling "son"?

1149
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,446
- You know why you don't sleep well?
- No, tell me.

1150
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,604
You with your iPhones
and your smartphones...

1151
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,410
...and your laptops and computers.

1152
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:17,724
All of which produce nothing
but a barrage of useless information.

1153
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,769
Fucking Twitter.

1154
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:25,762
As if anyone actually cares that you're
eating a turkey sandwich for lunch.

1155
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,567
Sorry. Panini.

1156
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,365
- Sarcasm?
-Satire.

1157
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,610
Fucking panini.

1158
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:36,969
Look, um, are we done?

1159
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,805
You might be.

1160
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:42,088
Who'd you pick up at the airport?

1161
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:45,244
- Garriga has you fucking following me?
- I got people there.

1162
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,607
- My computer guy.
- Why? ls there a problem?

1163
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,725
There won't be because he's fucking here.

1164
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:57,604
I got a little red hair on my taint
that tickles when something's afoot.

1165
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,330
And lately...

1166
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:03,646
...I've been scratching my nethers
like a fucking macaque.

1167
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:07,766
Okay.

1168
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:13,961
Look, there's no reason
for anybody to panic...

1169
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,489
...and start getting bent out of shape...

1170
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,847
...because we're getting to the end.

1171
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,485
Nice day.

1172
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:58,800
Nicky.

1173
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,371
How the fuck did you do--?

1174
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,200
Back here, 7.

1175
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,686
Okay.

1176
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,042
Uh, guess your taint was wrong.

1177
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,168
Enough of the pleasantries.

1178
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,365
Hey, nice jacket.

1179
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,760
Fuck off.

1180
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,886
It's real.

1181
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,491
Gordon!

1182
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,920
Gordon!

1183
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,645
Fucking you, mate.
You're my new fucking favorite person, fella.

1184
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,081
I swear
you're fucking 6 inches fucking taller...

1185
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,925
...and twice as fucking handsome
since you walked in here.

1186
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,605
There you go, son.

1187
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,047
- Lap it up.
-My pleasure, Mr. McEwen.

1188
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,921
- I wish you the best of luck.
-Friends like you, who needs luck?

1189
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,764
Now fuck off. Ha-ha.

1190
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,165
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Mr. Garriga.

1191
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,010
<i>- How did it go?
-It's</i> done.

1192
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,731
- Good.
-I wish you the best of luck.

1193
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,769
<i>With friends like you, who needs luck?</i>

1194
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:14,570
Jess, letting you know, uh, I left a key
for you at the desk. See you at 7.

1195
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,360
Wish you the best of luck.

1196
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,602
With friends like you, who needs luck?

1197
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:25,363

Jess.

1205
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,600
Fuck.

1206
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,411
Sorry I'm late.

1207
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,530
What?

1208
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:17,051
Nothing. Let's go.

1209
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:34,529
Do you really think I'm such an amateur
that I would not have someone with McEwen?

1210
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,444
Someone to keep eyes on you?

1211
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,846
<i>Hm'?</i>

1212
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,402
Twenty years in this business
teach you never to be too careful.

1213
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,120
He is my secret weapon.

1214
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,770
Now, heh, imagine my surprise...

1215
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,721
...when Gordon showed me
what you sold to McEwen.

1216
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:56,208
Not some fake softwares, as we discussed...

1217
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,441
...but my plans, my designs.

1218
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,840
The real EXR!

1219
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,810
Stolen from my servers, stolen from me!

1220
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:07,601
What's more, you sold it to McEwen
for 3 million euros.

1221
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:11,481
But in these bags, there is 27 million euros!

1222
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:13,802
Which means you sold it to everyone!

1223
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,290
This is my reputation. This is my standing.

1224
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,602
You've made me look like an amateur.

1225
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:30,881
Ah, that's what you get
when you hire a con man.

1226
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,491
Thieving piece of shit.

1227
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,526
How did you get the information? Hm?

1228
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,762
And what did she have to do with it?

1229
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,843
All right. Nothing. All right? Listen--

1230
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:46,445
-Tell me. Hm?
-Hey--

1231
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,924
Hm? Tell me!

1232
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,851
Leave her the fuck alone! I'll tell you!

1233
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,530
I have a guy.

1234
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,326
He cracked your encryption.

1235
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:21,286
<i>He found a back door into your server.</i>

1236
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,887
It was actually pretty easy.
You should probably fire your IT guy.

1237
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:26,963
No! You used my login. My password.

1238
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:30,363
- Computer tries every possible combination.
-Bullshit!

1239
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:35,203
This generates a new password
every 15 minutes.

1240
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,050
It never leaves my sight.

1241
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,526
- How did you get it?
-Who the fuck cares, man? It's done.

1242
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,045
Okay.

1243
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,651
Tell me!

1244
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,165
- I want to know how!
-Let her go!

1245
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:50,731
- How, how, how?
-Let her go!

1246
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,405
- How?
-All right. It was her!

1247
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,927
It was her. All right? It was her!

1248
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:56,411
It was her.

1249
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,925
It was her.

1250
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,205
But she didn't know.

1251
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,445
She didn't know anything.

1252
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,606
Okay.

1253
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,091
Your security was tight.

1254
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:16,765
It was tighter than I expected.

1255
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:20,531
<i>I thought I could break the key,
but I couldn't.</i>

1256
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,603
Then I saw Jess at the party.

1257
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,445
<i>And when I found out
that the two of you were together...</i>

1258
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,762
...I knew she was my in.

1259
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,410
So I used her.

1260
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:32,764
And I've been using her.

1261
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:37,443
You see, there's a science
to getting people to trust you.

1262
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,365
<i>With women, it's all about emotion.
Connection.</i>

1263
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:42,363
<i>That you feel the emotion...</i>

1264
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,284
...as strongly as they do.

1265
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:48,208
They've been dreaming about that shit
ever since they were little girls.

1266
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:50,966
<i>With her, it was shared history.</i>

1267
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:55,127
<i>A friendly face. Set her off balance.
Helps diffuse aggression.</i>

1268
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,566
You've lost so much weight!

1269
01:26:56,720 --> 01:26:59,200
<i>Start discussing emotional shit.</i>

1270
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:00,970
<i>They're disarmed.</i>

1271
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,361
<i>Now they're open.
You know you got them...</i>

1272
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,966
...when they start
to unconsciously mimic you.

1273
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,929
<i>A head nod.</i>

1274
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,481
<i>A hand gesture. It means you're in sync.</i>

1275
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:14,440
Sociologists refer to it
as the Gauchais Reaction.

1276
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,001
And then you move in for the kill.

1277
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,447
You tell them how they've changed you.

1278
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,329
I'm different, Jess.

1279
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,403
Changed how you see the world.

1280
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:25,485
<i>Then you close.</i>

1281
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:26,926
<i>A talisman.</i>

1282
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:28,684
<i>A gift that says:</i>

1283
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:31,161
<i>You've always been in my thoughts.</i>

1284
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:34,130
<i>The necklace had a wireless keylogger in it.</i>

1285
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,842
<i>All I needed was for her to enter your room.</i>

1286
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:43,962
And when she did that, I had what I needed.

1287
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,084
<i>Picked up on your keystrokes.</i>

1288
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:52,965
<i>I logged in to your computer as you...</i>

1289
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,207
...and downloaded everything
about the EXR.

1290
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:02,366
I'm sorry.

1291
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:07,365
But it was not her fault.

1292
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:09,530
She had no idea.

1293
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:11,210
She got fooled.

1294
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,209
So why don't we let her go?

1295
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,729
And me and you can do
whatever the fuck you need to do.

1296
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:50,926
I think he's lost his mind.

1297
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:52,680
What's funny?

1298
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,486
More bullshit.

1299
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:56,250
What is so funny?

1300
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,811
More lies.

1301
01:28:58,520 --> 01:28:59,760
What the fuck is so funny?

1302
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,285
What's so funny?

1303
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:05,931
Garriga's not my boyfriend.

1304
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,442
- What?
-I hardly even know him.

1305
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,011
She's just a race skank.

1306
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:12,446
What's a race skank?

1307
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,011
- But I saw you--
-No.

1308
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:17,010
You saw what I wanted you to see.

1309
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:18,850
<i>You taught me that, remember?</i>

1310
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,886
She's been driving me crazy.

1311
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,447
Hanging around, flirting, teasing.

1312
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,171
The minute I try to get her up to my room:

1313
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,603
- But I have a headache.
-Cramps.

1314
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:30,961
That time of the month.

1315
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:32,770
It's like a crime scene.

1316
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:34,285
I have Scrabble in my room.

1317
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:35,966
A headache.

1318
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,724
A period. Right?

1319
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:40,168
The world's longest period.

1320
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:42,290
She's never even been in my room.

1321
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,087
- What?
-We're so screwed.

1322
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,330
What the fuck?

1323
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,050
I was trying to--

1324
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,440
What the fuck, Jess?

1325
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,967
I was trying to steal his watch.

1326
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:56,726
- This watch?
-You're not still doing watches.

1327
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,245
It's a Piaget Emperador.

1328
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,641
It's worth 200 grand.

1329
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,406
<i>I'd been on him for a week.
I was waiting for my chance.</i>

1330
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:05,085
<i>And then you showed up.</i>

1331
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:09,325
- You are so much better than watches, Jess.
-it's what I am good at and I like it.

1332
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,925
Okay, no, no, no. When you came
to my hotel, he had roughed you up.

1333
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,128
No. He had roughed me up.

1334
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:18,169
She was stealing from him.

1335
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,800
<i>He caught me charging Garriga's credit line...</i>

1336
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,850
-...and scared the <i>shit</i> out of me.
- This is really fucking unbelievable.

1337
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,685
You did all of this to make me jealous?

1338
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:30,003
No. Some of it was payback
for New Orleans, but--

1339
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,605
Yeah, to make you jealous.

1340
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,603
I cannot believe you lied to me.

1341
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,842
- You can't believe I lied?
-Can't believe it.

1342
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,162
- You can't believe I lied?
-I can't believe it.

1343
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:41,688
- Oh, that's so rich from you. So rich.
-That's what you wanna say to me?

1344
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:45,606
- Yeah, because there's always a job.
-Be sure. I just tried to save your life.

1345
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:49,481
By lying! Because you're always lying, Nicky!

1346
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:52,962
I don't know when you're telling the truth.
And now we're dead.

1347
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,326
Fuck.

1348
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,245
She's right.

1349
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,686
You're right.

1350
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,249
Heh. Here's the thing about lying.
Here's the problem:

1351
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:30,244
Fucks up all your options.
Paints you into a corner.

1352
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,528
What the fuck you talking about?
You out of your mind?

1353
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:37,242
And then you're forced
to do some really dumb shit.

1354
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:41,530
- You wanna die?
-Well, if I die, I wanna die telling the truth.

1355
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:45,930
And if I lie, I wanna lie
like normal people lie.

1356
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:49,607
I want my wife to say, "Hey, honey.
Do I look fat in these jeans?"

1357
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:50,921
And I wanna say:

1358
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:55,768
"No, sweetie. You look terrific.
You should wear those."

1359
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,405
That's how I wanna lie.

1360
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:00,931
But this...

1361
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:03,930
If I'm done...

1362
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:06,883
...I'm gonna tell the truth.

1363
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:12,924
So, Mr. Garriga,
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

1364
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:14,691
RAUGHS]

1365
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:18,921
And you are not gonna like it at all.

1366
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:23,605
About a year ago,
I pick up the phone--

1367
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,769
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Nicky?

1368
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:29,605
I couldn't take another fucking word.

1369
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:30,966
You're next, honey.

1370
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:34,408
- No! Are you crazy?
-Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.

1371
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:36,608
What the hell were you thinking? Huh?

1372
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,046
Fuck you.

1373
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:41,326
Now somebody's hurt.

1374
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:44,165
You know what?
I have nothing to do with this.

1375
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,288
Look at me. Look at me. It's okay.

1376
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:49,762
This is your mess.
You clean it up. And keep me out of it.

1377
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,004
I don't know what to do. Please--

1378
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,127
Please, please, stay with me.
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1379
01:32:58,280 --> 01:32:59,645
No, no, no. No. Look at me.

1380
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:03,242
Look at me. Look at me. It's fine.
Nicky, look at me. Look at my eyes.

1381
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:04,765
I love you, okay? I love you.

1382
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:06,684
Please. Please, don't do this. Please.

1383
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:09,686
Please.

1384
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,410
I trust you.

1385
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,641
You cannot leave me again.

1386
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,361
Please, do not leave me again.

1387
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:33,806
Please.

1388
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:43,964
What the fuck?
You want him to fucking die?

1389
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:46,851
What kind of a piker are you,
for chrissakes?

1390
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:51,571
Oh, shit! Didn't he tell you
I was on the inside?

1391
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,166
Jesus.

1392
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:54,845
You must be terrified.

1393
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:57,721
It's gonna be okay. He is not gonna die.

1394
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:00,486
Do you hear me? He is not gonna die.

1395
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:02,410
Probably.

1396
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:05,404
You see, you shoot between the third
and the fourth rib...

1397
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:08,404
...just about eleven o'clock
off the left nipple. Here.

1398
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:11,564
- Hold pressure on that. Hold pressure on that.
-Okay.

1399
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:14,481
That misses the heart and the major arteries.

1400
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,881
It does, however, puncture the lung.
Let me in.

1401
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:18,371
There we go.

1402
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,010
Is this Toledo Panic Button?

1403
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,640
Oh, maybe you're not such a piker after all.

1404
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:26,003
Left untreated, you got about 10 minutes...

1405
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,606
...before you drown in your own blood.

1406
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:31,081
But you patch it up...

1407
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,845
- ...you account for the cavity pressure.
- Oh.

1408
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,889
- Agh.
- Oh, God.

1409
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,246
And then...

1410
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:42,762
There we are. There we go.

1411
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,285
There we go.

1412
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:46,408
- There's my boy.
-Ah!

1413
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:47,891
- Oh, Jesus.
- There's my boy.

1414
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:51,123
- Ah. Agh!
- Are you okay?

1415
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,888
- Oh, Jesus.
-Here. Hold on to that. Hold on to that.

1416
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:58,209
Keep your eye on that. If he can't breathe,
you pull the plunger again.

1417
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,566
-Okay?
-Okay.

1418
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,451
Good Lord, I cannot believe
that you made me shoot you.

1419
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:06,286
And then for what? So that you can make
cow eyes at some race skank!

1420
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:09,127
- She is not a race skank!
-I'm not a race skank!

1421
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,760
You die with the lie, Mellow...

1422
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,809
...and you still just might.

1423
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:16,201
- Fuck you. Don't call me "Mellow."
Jesus Christ.

1424
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:17,805
You're his dad?

1425
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:20,281
In the loosest fucking possible terms.

1426
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,331
I'm Bucky, by the way.

1427
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:24,967
You know, I like you, honey.
You can take a punch. Ha-ha.

1428
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,329
- God.
- And there it is.

1429
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:30,450
Tell you what, you steal us a car,
and I'll gather up the money.

1430
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:31,931
I can't steal a car.

1431
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:43,566
I've been working
for this prick Spaniard for three years...

1432
01:35:43,720 --> 01:35:46,405
...and he's got a guy at McEwen
and doesn't tell me?

1433
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,801
What the hell ever happened to trust?

1434
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,485
Are we almost there?

1435
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:53,843
I bust my ass to get you
that EXR crap and... Agh.

1436
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,330
And then the girl walked in.

1437
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,841
Don't be an asshole.

1438
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,843
That any way to talk to your father?

1439
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,411
You're not my father. You walked away.

1440
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,523
I took you off the street.

1441
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:19,604
Taught you my trade,
I taught you my passion.

1442
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:23,881
Three generations of skills.

1443
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:31,001
Ah. And in spite of all my earnest efforts,
in spite of all my hard work...

1444
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,288
...you turned into a good person.

1445
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:34,805
Well, I just--

1446
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,089
Ah. Go figure.

1447
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:43,284
And I left you on the street
for a good goddamn reason.

1448
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:46,723
- Because I was soft.
-Oh, that just shows what you know...

1449
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,167
...you dumb son of a bitch.

1450
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,729
We had a good thing going.

1451
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:02,808
And then one day...

1452
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:07,249
...like seven years in, we're running
this poker deal in Boston...

1453
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:09,050
...and a guy pulled a gun.

1454
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:10,770
Fucking gun. Glock.

1455
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:12,729
First time I'd ever seen one.

1456
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:15,326
And I'm just paralyzed.

1457
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,166
<i>Heh.</i>

1458
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:21,369
And all I could think about was the kid.

1459
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:26,249
That night I walked. I never looked back.

1460
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,281
Love'll get you killed in this racket.

1461
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,843
No place for that shit here.

1462
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:39,369
No happiness with that.

1463
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:45,448
You know how they say
there's honor among thieves.

1464
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:48,442
Well, you're no thief, Mellow.

1465
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:53,084
You made your choice.

1466
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:00,360
- So I'm taking the money.
-Mmm.

1467
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:02,645
All of it.

1468
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:06,081
- Mm-mm.
Uh-huh.

1469
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:12,249
Well, that explains a lot.

1470
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:13,970
Yeah, that's Dad.

1471
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:18,802
- No.
-Yep.

1472
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:24,845
See you at Christmas.

1473
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,482
<i>One, two, ready?</i>

1474
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:37,482
Okay, that's good, that's good.

1475
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:41,002
- Mm.
-Okay, almost there.

1476
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,967
I don't know what we're gonna do now.

1477
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,205
We'll be fine.

1478
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,006
How?

1479
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:51,200
Trust me.

1480
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,887
- Oh. I got you.
-Agh.

1481
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:03,886
I got you.
